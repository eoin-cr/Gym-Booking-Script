# Gym script
Script that can search for and book a selected UCD gym slot.

Disclaimer: The script is just for educational purposes and I cannot be held responsible for any repercussions of using or attempting to use this script.

Note: I have not tried fully book a slot with this script so I am not certain whether the final post request will sucessfully book a slot.  However, in theory I believe it should.

If you want to run the code make sure you have a file called `.env` in the same directory as the script.  The .env file should be formatted like
```
#.env
STUDENT_NUMBER=YOUR STUDENT NUMBER HERE
```
